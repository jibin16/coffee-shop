        <div class="row">Ever heard of a barista describing coffee tasting notes with fruits like blueberry, melon or lemon?<br>
        To the mass majority, when asked to describe the flavor notes of coffee, the adjective “bitter” comes up more often than not. This is especially evident to people who dislike drinking coffee as the harsh bitterness is what deters them from this beverage. 
        A conventional method to cover the bitterness is through the addition of milk and sugar; pretty effective. As the specialty coffee wave spreads throughout the world. One would often hear coffee connoisseurs describing their coffee with flavor notes which does not make any sense. Chocolaty? Caramel? Blueberry? </div>

        <h1>TYPES</h1>
        <p>When it comes to the rich and diverse world of coffee, there are several factors that contribute to its flavor and aroma. Understanding these factors is key to appreciating the intricate taste profiles and sensory experiences that different types of coffee offer. Let’s explore the elements that influence the delicious notes found in your favorite cup of joe. <br><br>
            ★<b> Types of Bean:</b> Coffee beans are actually seeds from the coffee plant. They are not technically beans, but got that name as their shape resembles a bean. The coffee seed may also be called a pip, cherry, or stone. Most coffee fruits contain two beans though a single bean is present about 10% of the time. The beans are generally hand picked when ripe, and the fruit is stripped from the seed by either a dry or wet method before the beans are roasted. <br> <br>
            ★<b> Types of Roast:</b>Though the bean itself matters, coffee gets a lot of its aroma and flavor from the roasting process. The length of the roasting process can affect many things, including the body, acidity, and flavor of your tasty beans. To help you expand your coffee knowledge, we have put together this handy guide to the four major types of coffee roasts.
            The four types of coffee roasts are light roast, medium roast, medium-dark roast, and dark roast. Each of these roast levels has a different aroma, appearance, and flavor. Keep reading to learn all about the four types of coffee roasts! <br><br>
            ★<b> Types of Grind:</b>How do you take your coffee? Whatever way you answer, you need to grind up the beans first. Coffee grind is the coffee beans’ coarseness level once you grind them up for brewing.
            While it may not seem it when you order your daily cup or open up a bag of beans to brew your own at home, the way you drink your coffee relates to the coffee’s grind.Just as there are many different types of coffee, there are many kinds of coffee grinds.
            The three main coffee grinds are coarse, medium, and fine, although each type has hybrid grinds. The different types of grinds depend on the type of brew you wish to make. <br><br>
            ★<b> Decaffeinated coffee:</b>Decaffeinated coffee, known as decaf for short, is ordinary coffee that has had most of its caffeine removed from it before the beans are roasted. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for a coffee to be marketed as "decaffeinated," it must have had at least 97 percent of its original caffeine  <br><br>

It is here where Starbucks opened its first store, offering fresh-roasted coffee beans, tea and spices from around the world for our customers to take home. Our name was inspired by the classic tale, “Moby-Dick,” evoking the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.
            Ten years later, a young New Yorker named Howard Schultz would walk thro its coffee culture to Starbucks. By 1987, we swapped our brown aprons for green ones and

                <h3>2.Dunkin’ Donuts</h3> <br> <P>
           In 1948, Bill Rosenberg opened a donut restaurant called “Open Kettle’’ on Southern Artery in Quincy, Massachusetts. (Notably, the restaurant is still there today.) In 1950, it was renamed Dunkin’ Donuts. Five years later, the first franchise was signed in Worcester and by 1963, there were 100 Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants in operation. In 1972, the famous Munchkins were released; muffins were added to the menu in 1978. In 1979, the 1,000th franchise opened its doors and by 1990, there were 2,000 Dunkin’ Donuts locations. That number grew to 3,000 in 1992. Bagels were added to the menu in 1996 and breakfast sandwiches made their Dunkin’ debut in 1997. In 2004, company headquarters moved to Canton, Massachusetts and in 2006, the company began its now-famous “America Runs on Dunkin’” marketing campaign. (It’s worth noting that Dunkin’ Donuts was acquired by a consortium of private equity firms that same year.) In the late 2010s, Dunkin’ Donuts changed their name simply to Dunkin’. The company noted that the change was due in part to their increased emphasis on drinks. Today, there are over 12,500 Dunkin’ locations in 46 countries

                    <h3>3.McCafe</h3> <br> <P>
                        it‘s the early 1990s in Melbourne, Australia. While McDonald‘s is already globally known for quick, tasty, and affordable meals, the company sees an opportunity to bring gourmet coffee shop culture to the fast food world. In 1993, the very first McCafe opens its doors.
                        The vision was to create a sophisticated yet inviting atmosphere, bridging the gap between rushed takeaway coffee and leisurely cafe experiences. From the beginning, McCafe offered a wider variety of espresso-based drinks compared to standard McDonald‘s fare. Touches like comfortable seating and free WiFi aimed to encourage customers to stay and relax for a while.
